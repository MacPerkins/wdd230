                <h1>Target Audience</h1>
                <p>Our audience include business owners, community organizers, and citizens of Layton City. For our business owners we will provide information about the market of our city, areas for new and developing start-up businesses, and contact information regarding where they might start their business ventures. We provide forums, community pages, and links to established neighboorhood and city social media pages, for event organizers wanting to bring awareness to whatever cause they support, and for citizens and community members to find and connect with each other and local businesses.</p>
                <h2>Two Personas</h2>
                <p>An middle-aged woman without any close-by children is looking to find ways to participate and serve in the community. They also see all the new housing being established and want to get to know their neighbors and fellow city members better by participating in city events or even more local neighborhood events. They are also looking for areas of new development in housing and businesses to invite their friends and family to come live and enjoy time in our quickly growing city.
                
                A successful businessman franchisee looking to start up another well established fast-food restaurant in the area. He sees the ever growing housing development with tons of young families moving in, and see the amazing business opportunity at hand, so they reach out to the city chamber for information regarding areas they might construct their restaurant and what resources are available to them for construction.

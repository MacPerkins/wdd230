        Short Explanation of HotShot.
        HotShot is the only online shooting competition platform. From the ease of any gun range, compete with other gun owners around the world in multi shooting categories. Hone your shooting skills with all pistols and all rifles at long and short range, and see how you match up with friends, family, and local or national shooter’s.
        Why you need it?
        Every gun owner and casual shooter has a competitive spirit but might not have the time or resources to attend shooting competitions which may or may not be in their area. Seeing a deficiency in the gun owner community, we decided to make competitive shooting available to all by creating our app, HotShot.
        How does it work?
        Our app HotShot uses your camera and photo identification software to analyze your target and calculate a specific score based off a few metrics. You simply take a picture of your target before your round of firing, then you take a clear picture of your target for calculation of your score. You can see how accurate you were at whatever range you shot at, and with our shot timer you can see how well you performed in a certain space of time.

      <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
      <p>
        What type of target do I use?
        There are two main ways to get targets for your shooting pleasure. Our app requires you to use our variety of targets for the time being as calculation of your score is depended on the predetermined scale and layout of our targets. Our website includes our free printable targets which you can use if you need some simple targets in a pinch. Through our website you can also order relatively inexpensive targets of varying size and styles. That way if you want a wider variety of targets for more long-range shots, you can have them!
        What is included in the app?
        Our app currently includes our easy to print targets for use at any range, as well as our target scanner. Once signed into your newly created account, you can save and view your previous targets and scores made over the history of your account. You can view your high-scores within our pre-created categories of rifle and pistol at long and short ranges. You can also narrow your scores down to the individual caliber of gun you are using, as well as the gun model. When you select the category of gun and range you used, you can compare your scores to other user’s scores across the nation!
        How can I share my scores and progress with my friends?
        So, you want to be a better shot than your friends? Sharing your personal scores to finally settle it is made easy through our app sharing. You can send your friends a link to your personal scores through text, email, or however you get around. If you want to post your personal shooting to your friends and followers on social media, you can do so easily through our cross platform sharing with Instagram and Facebook.

        How we started.
        We started out like you did; simple gun owners looking to have a little competitive fun. As a family of outdoors loving people, we wanted to find a way to compete against family and friends while shooting but couldn’t find any options out there that were close to our location and were being done frequently. Once we realized that through the convenience of an app you could compete with other shooters around the world and not have to worry about a schedule, our idea for HotShot was born. Since then, our app and online community has grown and helped fulfill our dream of making competitive shooting available to every gun owner.
